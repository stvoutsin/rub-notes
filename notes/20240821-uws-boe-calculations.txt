Some stats on TAP usage over past 6 days and some rough Back-of-envelope calculations for how the UWS database might scale for 1000 users:

The stats were collected as:
TAP Service:
  TAP/idfprod (UWS stored in CloudSQL)

Start Date:
  August 15th 2024

End Date:
  August 21th 2024

Total Days:
  6



Total Queries:
  SELECT count(*) FROM uws.job
  62214

Number of users:
  30

Expected number of users:
  1000

Queries per Day:
  62214 / 6
  10369 queries (rows)

Expected Rows (1 year): 
  q_per_day * 1000/30 * 365
  125 million rows

Expected Rows (5 years):
  630 million rows


Total size of uws.job (6 days):
  SELECT pg_total_relation_size('uws.job') AS total_size;
  20357120 ~= 19.41Mb

Total size of uws.jobdetail (6 days):
  SELECT pg_total_relation_size('uws.jobdetail') AS total_size;
  ~= 66 Mb

Average size per row (uws.job):
  SELECT pg_total_relation_size('uws.job')::numeric / COUNT(*) AS avg_row_size FROM uws.job;
  ~326.38 bytes


Expected Database size for 1000 Users:

  uws.job:
    1 Year: Approximately 38 GB
    5 Years: Approximately 190 GB

  uws.jobdetail:
    1 Year: Approximately 130 GB
    5 Years: Approximately 650 GB


Non-indexed table scan duration for larger table: 650Gb
  (Assuming SSD 200Mb/s read-speed)
  665600 Mb/200Mb/s = 3328 seconds ~= 55 minutes


What about adding indexes?
  Assuming an index adds about 100bytes per row
  If we want to add 1 index to jobdetail:
  New jobdetail table size= 650Gb + 50Gb = 700Gb


What columns are indexed currently:
  uws.job:
    job_creationtime
    job_ownerid
    job_pkey
	
uws.jobdetail:
    jobdetail_fkey

If these are the only columns a query history client would filter on we can expect a few ms - seconds duration in the 5 year scenario
